### batch processing or stream processing 

batch processing processes large valume of data at fixed intervals (for example, hourly, monthly , yearly) .
data is collected over time , stored and then processed together as a batch 

suitable for historical data 
const effective 
slightly delay in data availability 

example ; daily sales report generated using glue and spark 

stream processing processes data in real time or near real time as it is generated '
each eventy is processed imideatly or with in second 

used when low latency is requered 
ideal for real time analytics 
more complex and resource intensive 

example ;real time clickstream or fraud detection using kafka / aws kinesis 

one line interview summary :
batch processing handle data in scheduled chunks , while stream processing handles data continuously in real time .
