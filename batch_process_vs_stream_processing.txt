### batch processing or stream processing 

batch processing processes large valume of data at fixed intervals (for example, hourly, monthly , yearly) .
data is collected over time , stored and then processed together as a batch 

suitable for historical data 
const effective 
slightly delay in data availability 

example ; daily sales report generated using glue and spark 

stream processing processes data in real time or near real time as it is generated '
each eventy is processed imideatly or with in second 

used when low latency is requered 
ideal for real time analytics 
more complex and resource intensive 

example ;real time clickstream or fraud detection using kafka / aws kinesis 

one line interview summary :
batch processing handle data in scheduled chunks , while stream processing handles data continuously in real time .

#### what are fact table and dimension table ?
in a data warehouse , data is organized using fact table and dimesion table to support efficient analysis 

fact table 

fact table store quantitative , measurable data related to business process 
contain metrics (number)
ususally very large 
contain forign key that links to dimesion table 

exampe of fact table :
sales amount 
quantity sold 
revenue 
number of transaction

#### dimension table :
a dimesion table store descriptive , contexual information that explain fact 

contains attribute 
smaller in size 
used in filtering , grouping , and labeling data 

example of dimesions:
customer (name, age, location )
product(category , brand )
date(day , month ,year)

fact table store business metrics , while dimension table store discriptive information use to analize those metrics 


#### star schema and snowflake schema 

star schema and snowflake schema are data modeling techniques used in data warehouse to organize fact and dimesion table 

star schema 
a central fact table is directly connected to multiple denortmalized dimension table , forming a star like structure 

key point :
simple design 
faster query performance 
fewer joins 
easy to understand 

best for ; reporting and bi queries 

#### snowflake schema 
in snowflake schema , dimension table normalized into multiple related table , creating a snowflake like structure 

key point : more complex design 
require more joins 
saves storage space 
better for complex dimension 

best for ; complex dimension management 

quick comparison :
structure :
star schema has denormalized dimensions and snowflake shema has normalized dimensions 

query speed: 
star schema 's query speed is faster whie snowflake schema query speed slow 

complexity :
simple for star schema and complex for snowflake schema 

storage :
more for star schema  and less for snowflake schema
