### what is basiacclly data engineer do from start to end explain widly like a architecture 

a data engineer basically design , build, and maintain the complete data pipeline , 
from raw data coming from different source to clean , structured data that analyst and data scientist can use 

1. data source (where data comes from):
this is the starting point 
common data source 
database : mysql, postgresql, mongodb
applications : web apps , mobile apps (user click logs )
api ; payment gateway , third party service 
files ; csv , json , excel 
streaming data: sensor , iot , kafka events 

example ;  user open an app -> click a button -> event data generated 

2. data ingestion :
bringing data inside 

a data engineer deside how data enters into system 

type of ingestion 

batch ingestion 
data collected periodically (hourly/daily )
tools ; airflow .cron jobs , spark 

real time / streaming ingestion 
continuous data flow 
tools ; kafka , aws kinesis , flink 

example 
daily sales csv : batch 
live user activity : streaming 

3. data processing (cleaning and transforming) 
raw data is messy and useless - this step make it usable 

what happen here :
remove dublicate 
handle missing values 
convert formats 
apply business logic 
join multiple datasets 

tools used :
apache spark 
python , pandas pyspark 
sql 
databricks 

4. data storage (where data live) 
after processing data is stored in different layer 
data lake (raw = semi processed )
stores hug raw data 
cheap and scalable 
tools : s3, azure data lake , hdfs 

data warehouse (clean and structured )
optimize for analytics 
tools ; snowflake , bigquery , redshift 

rule :
dzata lake : storage 
data warehouse ; analysis 

5 data modeling : making data analyst friendly 

here , data engineer design tables so queries run fast 

common models :
star schema 
snowflake schema 

6 . data orchestration :(automation)
pipelines must run automatically  and realabily 
responsibility :
schedule job 
retry on failure 
monitor pipelines

tools:
apache airflow
prefect 
dagster 

example 
1 am : ingest data 
2 am : clean data 
3am ; load warehouse 

7. data quality and validation :
data engineer ensure trustworthy data 

checks ;
null value 
schema mismatch 
dublicate records 
unexpected spikes 

tools ;
great expectation 
custom sql checks 

if data is wrong , business decision become wrong 

8. data serving ; who use the data 

final processed data is used by:
data analyst: dashboard (powerbi, tablaeu)
data scienyist : ml model 
backend system ; apis , recommendation
business team ; report 

monitoring , security and optimization :
a real data engineer also handle pipeline failure 
cost optimization 
access control 
performance tuning 

tools; 
cloudwatch , prometheus 
iam roles 
query optimization 

what data engineer actually does daily 
build elt /  etl pipeline 
write sql and python code 
work with big data tools 
optimize data flow 
ensure data reliability '
collaborate with analyst and ml team 

so i understand all thing
