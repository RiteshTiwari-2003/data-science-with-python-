python is an object oriented , interpreted, , high level programming language , it is general purpose 
and we use it to develop gui and web application 

with python we can concentratye on  the business logic of our code rahter than spent on common programming tasks 

###  history 

python was created by guido van rossom 
the initial code was published a s version 0.9 in 1991 and it grew up to version 1 till 1994
ever wondered why it called as python ?
it is named after bbc show monty's python flying circus 

#### why python ?
there are 1000 language then why python ?
python is simple and easy to learn 
it has library for almost every thing , django for web application and matplotllib for data visualization 
it is reliable ,efficient and time saving 
it has large helpfull and open source community 
it offeres career opportuity in various field 

#### where can we use python ?

hardware programming 
respberry pi 

machine learning , ds and deep learning 
sklearn , tenserflow theano and spark 

web application 
django , flask and tornado 

cloud and dev ops 
openstack apis and fabric

desktop application 
pygtk and cocoa

#### python variable 
a variable is memory location where we can stoe value ,
in python the data type will be identified according to data we provide 

a variable should start with letter or underscore but does not start with nmumber 
there are two way to assigning alue to a vRIABLE 
1. assigning a single value 
2. assigning multiple value 

#### python token 

in python every logical  line of code is broken down into component known as token 
normal token type 
identifier 
keywords 
literals 
operator 

keyword :
python keywords are spacial reserve words 
they convey spacial meaning to compiler or interpreter
each keyword has special meaning and a specia operation 
never use it as a variable 

python keyword:

true False None and as 
Asset def class continue break 
else finally elif del except 
global for if from import 
raise try or return pass 
nonlocal in not is lambda 

identifier :
identifier is the name used to identify a vatriable , function , class or object 

no spacial character , except underscore can be used as an identifirer 
keyword should not be used as identifier 
python is  case sensitive like "Var" and var has different 
the first character of identifier either can be underscore or any alphabate 

literals :
literals are just raw data given to the variable 
various type of literals :
string literals
numeric literals 
boolean literals 
special literals 
'',"".'''   .....'''

numeric literals :
formed by a character string of digit 0 to 9 , decimal point   , and plus /minus sign 
numeric literal format 
int ,long , float , complex 

special literals ;
special literal in python is None which means that the variable is yet to be initialized 

val2=None 
print(val2)
type(val2)
None 
NoneType

Operators 
operator are special symbols that are used to carry out airthmatic logical operation 
various type of operators 
airthmatic , assignment , comparison , logical , bitwise , identity , membership 
identity operator used to check whether the object are same or not 
is : return ture if both the variable ar esame object 
and 
is  not : return true if both the variable are not same object
