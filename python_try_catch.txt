#### python try catch 
the try block lets you test a block of code for errors

the except block lets you handle the error 
the else block lets you execute code when there is no error 

the finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try and except block 

#### exception handling 
when an error occur or exception as we call it , python will normally stop and generate an error message 
these exceptioon can be handled suing the try statement 

example:
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("an exception handled")

the try block raise an error , the except block will be executed 
this statement print(x) raise an error because variable x is not defined 

### many exception 
you can define as many exception blocks as you want , if you want to execute a spacial block of code for 
a spacial kind of error 

try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("variable x is not defined ")
except:
    print("something else went wrong ")
