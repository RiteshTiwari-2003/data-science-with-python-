#### what is schema on read and wehat is schema on write , what is difference between schema on read and schema on write 

what is data ware house?
a data warehouse is centralized system used to store structured , historical data from multiple sources 
in a format optimized for fast querying , reporting analytics 

it is designed for read heavy workload , support complex sql queries and help organization 
make data driven decision 

key characterstics :
store integrated data from different sources
optimized for analytics, not transaction 
contains historical and  aggregated data 
uses schema like star schema and snowflake schema 

example:
snowflake 
google big query 
amazon redshift 

#### what is data lake ?
a data lake is a centralized storage system that store raw data in its original format, structured , semi structured , un structured 
at large scale .

it is mainly used for data storage , exploration , advance analytics 

amazon s3, azure data lake, hdfs , google cloud storage 

differencebetween data lake and data ware house 
data type:
in data lake , structured , semi structured , un structured , raw 
and in data warehouse cleaned , structured

schema : 
in data lake schema on read and in data warehouse schema on write 

purpose:
in data lake storage and exploration in data warehouse analytics and reporting 

cost:
low cost storage in data lake and in data warehouse higher cost 

query performance :
slower in data lake (need processing ) and in data warehouse fast (optimized)

users:
data engineer , data scientist in data lake 
analyst , buisness user in data warehouse 

example:
data lake : amazon s3, azure data lake , hdfs , google cloud storage 
data ware house : snowflake , redshift , bigquery

### schema on write and schema on read 

schema on write means the schema is defined before data is stored 
data is validated , cleaned and transformed before losding into storage 

.. used in data warehouse 
.. ensure high quality data 
.. less flexible for changing data 

exampe ; snowflake , redshift 

### schema on read :
means the schema is applied when the data is read or queried , not at storage time .
raw data stored first and sturcture is define later during analysis 

.. used in data lake 
.. very flexible 
..  suitable for large and diverse data .

exampe ; amazon s3, azure data lake , hdfs , google cloud storage
